# MarketData

Version 1.0

ABOUT:
* This is my internal use lib for reading/writing EOD stock market data
* Mostly interacts with data downloads from EODData.com and a local H2 DB
* Probably not useful to anyone but me, but my recent flink/nifi demo uses it, so I'm putting it on github
* Java 8 compatible.
